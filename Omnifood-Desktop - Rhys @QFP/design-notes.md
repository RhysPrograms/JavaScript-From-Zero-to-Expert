## Typography

Serifs, are a fine line finishing off the main strokes of a letter, as at the top and bottom of M. San-serifs on the other hand give a modern look and feel, and notably do not have that fine line finishing off a stroke.

1. Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe.
2. It's okay to use just one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces.
3. Choose the right typeface according to your website personality.
4. When choosing font-sizes, limit choices! Use a "type-scale" range tool or other pre-defined range.
5. For any text, don't use a font-weight under 400 (regular).
6. Use less than 75 characters per line.
7. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5.
8. Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small, bold, and decrease the letter-spacing.
9. Don't justify your text.
10. Don't center long text blocks.

## Colors

1. Make the main color match your website's personality. Colors convey meaning!
2. Use a good color tone. Don't choose a random tone or CSS named colors.
3. You need at least two types of colors in your palette: a main color and a grey color.
4. With more experience, you can add more colors: accent colors (use a tool).
5. For diversity, create darker and lighter versions (tints and shades).
6. Use your main color to draw attention to the most important elements on a page (e.g. buttons).
7. Use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components or sections stand out.
8. You can try to use your color strategically in images and illustrations.
9. On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of the background ("lighter version") for text.
10. Text should not usually be completely black. Lighten it up if it looks heavy and uninviting.
11. Don't make text too light as it will become unreadable! Use a tool to check contrast between text and background images - The contrast ratio needs to be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.

## Images

1. Different types of images: product photos, storytelling photos, illustrations, patterns.
2. Use images to support your website's message and story. So only use relevant images!
3. Prefer original images. If not possible, use original-looking stock images (not generic ones!).
4. Try to show real people to trigger user emotions.
5. If necessary, crop images to fit your message.
6. Experiment combining photos, illustrations, and patterns.
7. Method #1: Darker or brighten image (completely or partially, using a gradient).
8. Method #2: Position text into neutral image area.
9. Method #3 Put text in a box.
10. To account for high-res sreens, make image dimensions 2x as big as their displayed size.

- Scale factor: Actual pixels the screen contains / Pixels represented on screen.
- On high-res screens, scale factor is 2x or even 3x, on "normal" screens its just 1x (1 physical pixel = 1 design pixel)

11. Compress images for a lower file size and better performance (Sqoosh application)
12. When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the exact same dimensions.

## Icons

1. Use a good icon pack, there are tons of free (Phosphor Icons) and paid icon packs. Alternatively, you can just use emojis.
2. Use only one icon pack. Don't mix icons from different icon packs.
3. Use SVG icons or icon fonts. Don't use bitmap image formats (.jpg and .png).

- BitMap - Regular images (jpg, png, and gif) do not scale, and become unsharp.
- Vector-Based - (svg images, and icon fonts) scale undefinitely.

4. Adjust to website personality! Roundess, weight and filled/outlined depend on typography.
5. Use icons to provide visual assistance to text.
6. Use icons for product feature blocks.
7. Use icons associated with actions, and label them (unless no space or icon is 100% clear).
8. Use icons as bullet-points.
9. To keep icons neutral, use same color as text. To draw more attention, use different color.
10. Don't confuse your users: icons need to make sense and fit the text or action.
11. Don't make icons larger than what they were designed for. If needed, enclose them in a shape.

## Shadows

SKEUOMORPHIC DESIGN (REALISTIC)
FLAT DESIGN (MINIMAL)
FLAT DESIGN 2.0 (Still minimal, but brings back shadows and depth for better usability)

- Shadow creates depth (3D): the more shadow, the further away from the interface the element is.

1. You don't have to use shadows! Only use them if it fits the personality of your website.
2. Use shadows in small doses: don't add shadows to every element.
3. Go light on shadows, don't make them too dark!
4. Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw attention).
5. Use medium-sized shadows for larger area that should stand out a bit more.
6. Use large shadows for elements that should really float above the interface.
7. Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction (click and hover).
8. Bonus: Experiment with glows (colored shadows)

## Border-Radius

1. Use border-radius to increase the playfulness and fun of the design, to make it less serious.
2. Typefaces have a certain roundness: make sure that border-radius matches that roundness.
3. Use border-radius on buttons, images, around icons, standout sections and other elements.

## Whitespace

- The right amount of whitespace makes designs look clean, modern, and polished.
- Whitespace communicates how different pieces of information are related to one another.
- Whitespace implies invisible relationships between the elements of a layout.

1. Use tons of whitespace between sections.
2. Use a lot of whitespace between groups of elements.
3. Use whitespace between elements.
4. Inside groups of elements, try to use whitespace instead of lines.
5. The more some elements (or groups of elements) belong together, the closer they should be!
6. Start with a lot of whitespace, maybe even too much! Then remove whitespace from there. Too much whitespace looks detached, too little looks crammed.
7. Match other design choices. If you have big text or big icons, you need more whitespace.
8. Try a hard rule, such as using multiples of 16px for all spacing.

## Visual Hierarchy

Visual hierarchy is about establishing which elements of a design are the most important ones and thus drawing attention to them. Visual hierarchy is additionally about defining a "path" for users to guide them through the page. We can use a combination of position, size, colors, spacing, borders, and shadows to establish a meaningful visual hierarchy between elements/components.

1. Position important elements closer to the top of the page, where they will receive more attention.
2. Use images mindfully, as they draw a lot of attention (larger images get more attention).
3. Whitespace creates separation, so use whitespace strategically to emphasize elements.
4. For text elements, use font size, font weight, color, and whitespace to convey importance.
5. You can emphasize or de-emphasize text elements (titles, sub-titles, links, buttons, data points, icons).
6. Emphasize an important component using background color, shadow, or border.
7. What components to emphasize? Testimonials, call-to-action sections, highlight sections, preview cards, forms, pricing tables, important rows/columns in tables, etc.

## UX

Design is not what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works. - Steve Jobs

- Does the app feel logical and well thought out?
- Does the nav work intuitively?
- Are users reaching their goals?
- UX Design can not exist without UI Design.

1. Don't design complicated layouts. Don't reinvent the wheel. Use patterns that users know.
2. Make your call-to-action the most prominent element, and make the text descriptive.
3. Use blue text and underlined text ONLY for links!
4. Animations should have a purpose and be fast: between 200 and 500 ms.
5. In forms, align labels and fields in a single veritcal line in order to make the form easier to scan.
6. Offer users good feedback for all acitons: form errors, form success, etc.
7. Place action buttons where they will create an effect.
8. Use a descriptive, keyword-focused headline on your main page Don't be vague or fancy!
9. Only include relevant information, efficiently. Cut out fluff and make the content 100% clear.
10. Use simple words! Avoid technical jargon and "smart-sounding" words.
11. Break up long text with sub-headings, images, block quotes, bullet points, etc.
